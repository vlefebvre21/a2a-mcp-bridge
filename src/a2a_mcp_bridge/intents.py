"""Wake-up intent enum for ``agent_send`` (ADR-002).

An intent annotates a message with its delivery semantics. Current v0.6 scope
(Option gamma -- 5 values declared, binary wake behaviour):

* ``triage`` (default) — "read, reply if relevant, done". Current behaviour.
* ``execute`` — task handoff; recipient continues autonomously until done.
* ``review`` — structured review request (LGTM / REQUEST_CHANGES).
* ``question`` — needs an answer, not a task.
* ``fyi`` — heads up, no action required, no reply expected. **Wake skipped.**

The bridge itself enforces only the wake policy (skip wake for no-wake
intents). Semantic dispatch to specialised skills (``a2a-task-execution``,
``a2a-review-request``) is a Hermes-side concern tracked separately — see
ADR-002 §4 Hermes-side work.
